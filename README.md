# Introduction of Electricity Price Prediction

    The price of electricity depends on many factors. Predicting the price of electricity helps many businesses understand how much electricity they have to pay each year. The Electricity Price Prediction task is based on a case study where you need to predict the daily price of electricity based on the daily consumption of heavy machinery used by businesses.

    You do not know the actual cost of the electricity consumed by the machines throughout the day, but the organization has provided you with historical data of the price of the electricity consumed by the machines. Below is the information of the data we have for the task of forecasting electricity prices:
    

# About the Data
DateTime: Date and time of the record

Holiday: contains the name of the holiday if the day is a national holiday

HolidayFlag: contains 1 if itâ€™s a bank holiday otherwise 0

DayOfWeek: contains values between 0-6 where 0 is Monday

WeekOfYear: week of the year

Day: Day of the date

Month: Month of the date

Year: Year of the date

PeriodOfDay: half-hour period of the day

ForcastWindProduction: forecasted wind production

SystemLoadEA :forecasted national load

SMPEA: forecasted price

ORKTemperature: actual temperature measured

ORKWindspeed: actual windspeed measured

CO2Intensity: actual C02 intensity for the electricity produced

ActualWindProduction: actual wind energy production

SystemLoadEP2: actual national system load

SMPEP2: the actual price of the electricity consumed (labels or values to be predicted)

So your task here is to use this data to train a machine learning model to predict the price of electricity consumed by the machines.
